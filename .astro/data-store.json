At 10,358 feet, it's the third-tallest peak in Oregon and one of those hikes that locals talk about like a rite of passage. This September, I finally made the push to the top.\n\n## The Route\n\nI took the standard route from Green Lakes trailhead. That's the long way. It's 17.75 miles round trip with about 5,400 feet of elevation gain. Not technical, but relentless. The trail is well-marked through the forest for the first couple of miles, then breaks into open volcanic terrain that just goes up and up.\n\n![The trail through the volcanic terrain](~/assets/images/hiking/south-sister-trail.jpg)\n\n## The Climb\n\nStarted early to beat the afternoon weather. The lower section through the trees is pleasant enough, but the real work begins once you hit the moraine -- miles of loose volcanic scree where every step forward slides you half a step back. It's the kind of terrain that tests your patience as much as your legs.\n\nAbove the Lewis Glacier the air thins noticeably and the wind picks up. The final push to the summit ridge is steep and exposed, but you can see the crater lake below and the views start to open up in every direction.\n\n![The scree field on the way up](~/assets/images/hiking/south-sister-climb.jpg)\n\n## The Summit\n\nWorth every step. From the top you can see the entire Cascade chain -- Broken Top right next door, Bachelor to the south, Jefferson and Hood to the north. The crater lake sits below the rim, still holding patches of ice even in September. It's one of those views that makes you just stand there and not say anything for a while.\n\n![View from the summit](~/assets/images/hiking/south-sister-summit.jpg)\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- **Start early.** I was on the trail by 6am and glad I was. The afternoon clouds rolled in right as I was descending.\n- **Poles are not optional.** The scree sections are brutal on the knees, especially on the way down.\n- **Bring more water than you think.** The dry volcanic terrain and elevation combine to dehydrate you fast.\n- **Layer up.** It was 70 degrees at the trailhead and felt like 35 on the summit with wind chill.\n\nIf you're in Central Oregon and haven't done this one yet, put it on the list.

Broken Top dominates the skyline to the west, and the closer you get to Broken Hand, the more dramatic the volcanic geology becomes. Loose scree, jagged ridgelines, and views that just keep expanding.\n\n![Views opening up along the ridge](~/assets/images/hiking/broken-hand-ridge.jpg)\n\nPoppy led the charge the entire way, nose down and tail up.

Check them regularly.\n- **Leash up where required.** The Three Sisters Wilderness has leash regulations in certain areas -- know before you go.\n- **Start early.** The dogs will be happier in cooler temps, and so will you.\n\nPoppy and Gizmo slept the entire drive home.

Thunder echoing off the ridgelines, lightning flickering through the trees, rain hammering the tent fly. There’s something about a thunderstorm in the backcountry that makes you feel very small and very awake at the same time.
