Some of the best trips aren't the longest ones. In early September, my daughter Lily and I packed up for an overnight at Cabot Lake in the Mt. Jefferson Wilderness. Short hike in, one night under the stars (and the clouds), and back out the next day. Sometimes that's all you need.

## The Hike In

The trail to Cabot Lake is short enough that you're not suffering under a full pack for long. That's a nice feature when you're carrying overnight gear -- you spend less time grinding and more time actually being out there. The forest is dense and green, classic Mt. Jefferson Wilderness, with the kind of quiet that makes you forget there's a highway an hour behind you.

## Camp

We found a solid spot near the lake and set up camp. Cabot Lake is small and tucked in, surrounded by trees with Jefferson looming in the distance. It's the kind of place that feels more remote than it is. Lily and I got the tent up, filtered some water, and settled in.

## The Thunder

And then the storms rolled in. Thunder echoing off the ridgelines, lightning flickering through the trees, rain hammering the tent fly. There's something about a thunderstorm in the backcountry that makes you feel very small and very awake at the same time. We rode it out from inside the tent, listening to the whole show.

It passed, came back, passed again. Not exactly restful sleep, but the kind of night you remember.

## Morning

By morning the sky had cleared and the lake was glassy. We made coffee, packed up slow, and hiked out. No rush. That's the whole point of a one-nighter like this -- you're not trying to cover miles or bag a peak. You're just out there.

It was a good trip. Twenty years old and Lily still wants to go backpacking with her dad. I'll take every one of these I can get.
