One of the best things about living in Bend is having trails like this in the backyard. On September 23rd I loaded up Poppy and Gizmo and headed out to the Tam McArthur trailhead for a hike up to Broken Hand.

## The Trailhead

The Tam McArthur trailhead sits at about 6,400 feet and is the jumping-off point for some of the best views in the Three Sisters Wilderness. Parking can fill up on weekends, but a Tuesday in late September meant we practically had the place to ourselves.

## The Hike Up

The trail climbs steadily through the forest before opening up to the alpine terrain that makes this area so striking. Broken Top dominates the skyline to the west, and the closer you get to Broken Hand, the more dramatic the volcanic geology becomes. Loose scree, jagged ridgelines, and views that just keep expanding.

Poppy led the charge the entire way, nose down and tail up. Gizmo took a more measured approach -- sniffing every rock, checking every switchback twice. Between the two of them, morale was never an issue.

## Broken Hand

The final stretch to Broken Hand is steep and rugged. The dogs handled it better than most humans would -- sure-footed and completely unbothered by the exposure. At the top, you're rewarded with sweeping views of Broken Top's crater, the Three Sisters, and the high desert stretching east toward Bend.

We hung out at the top for a while. The dogs drank water, I ate a sandwich, and we all just sat there taking it in. Late September light in the Cascades is hard to beat.

## Dogs on the Trail

A few notes for anyone thinking about bringing their dogs up here:

- **Bring plenty of water.** There's not much available on the trail, and dogs burn through it fast at elevation.
- **Watch the scree.** The loose volcanic rock can be rough on paws. Check them regularly.
- **Leash up where required.** The Three Sisters Wilderness has leash regulations in certain areas -- know before you go.
- **Start early.** The dogs will be happier in cooler temps, and so will you.

Poppy and Gizmo slept the entire drive home. A good sign.
